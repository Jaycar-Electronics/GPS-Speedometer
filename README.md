# GPS Speedometer

Using our Arduino-compatible GPS module and TFT Screen, this project displays basic GPS information such as longitude, latitude, altitude, speed, and distance travelled from point A to B. Information are stored on an SD card which can be exported and viewed via Google Maps. Powered from a micro-USB for easy powering off your phone charger while youâ€™re in the car.

#### Notes

* **MCUFRIEND_kbv** needs to be modified to work with our TFT module.

* **SdFat** provides us with an interface to `FAT32` filesystems _as well as_ provides a **SoftwareSPI** bus. We use 'SoftSPI' due to the case that Leonardo does not have the SPI pins on 10~13 as traditional UNOs do. This library is perfect for our needs.
